Deno[Deno.internal]

@Luca can't code so you can't cross-compile Deno (or Node, I guess) because the build involves making V8 pre-compile the JS code that comes built into Deno (that implements the Deno APIs, for example), and the result is platform-specific
so Deno releases versions for the platforms Github Actions supports, plus a Mac M2 build that has to be done manually with every release by someone in the Deno core team

Deno, where there are only about 25 full-time employees.

Hit the language server document preload limit of 1000 file system entries. You may want to use the "deno.enablePaths" configuration setting to only have Deno partially enable a workspace or increase the limit via "deno.documentPreloadLimit". In cases where Deno ends up using too much memory, you may want to lower the limit.
