Deno[Deno.internal]

@Luca can't code so you can't cross-compile Deno (or Node, I guess) because the build involves making V8 pre-compile the JS code that comes built into Deno (that implements the Deno APIs, for example), and the result is platform-specific
so Deno releases versions for the platforms Github Actions supports, plus a Mac M2 build that has to be done manually with every release by someone in the Deno core team

Enabling import suggestions for: https://deno.land
Download https://deno.land/.well-known/deno-import-intellisense.json
Hit the language server document preload limit of 1000 file system entries. You may want to use the "deno.enablePaths" configuration setting to only have Deno partially enable a workspace or increase the limit via "deno.documentPreloadLimit". In cases where Deno ends up using too much memory, you may want to lower the limit.
Could not set npm package requirements. Error getting response at https://registry.npmjs.org/@types/node for package "@types/node": An npm specifier not found in cache: "@types/node", --cached-only is specified.
