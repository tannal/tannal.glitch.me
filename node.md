> The source code of Node.js itself is primarily written in C++ and JavaScript. The JS part is mostly under the lib directory and the C++ part is mostly under the src directory. There are also a bunch of third-party dependencies like v8 or libuv which are placed under the deps directory.

> The Node.js release binaries do not strip the debug symbols (surprised?) so you donâ€™t necessarily have to build a debug build to get meaningful C/C++ stack traces or to do step debugging in a native debugger like LLDB or GDB.
