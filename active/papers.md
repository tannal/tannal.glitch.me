        > My research interests include, but are not limited to:

        Program analysis: static and dynamic, abstract interpretation, type systems
        Programming languages semantics, interpreters
        Concurrency with actor systems and channels
        Security
        WebAssembly

        > The central theme of my research is the design of program analyses, and their application to problems in software quality:
        Static and dynamic analysis: slicing of WebAssembly, abstract reference counting, incremental and parallel abstract interpretation, full-stack and client-side JavaScript instrumentation
        Automated testing: resilience testing of distributed Akka applications, concolic testing of full-stack JavaScript applications, maintenance of Selenium test scripts
        Software maintenance and evolution: Scala test smell detection, querying object-oriented and aspect-oriented code, change queries, commit decomposition
        Software analytics, artificial intelligence for software engineering: design smell prediction, clustering library usage on StackOverflow, change pattern mining in commits, mining for patterns in Cobol, semantic version suggestion for Ansible role releases, automated tagging of libraries, search-based tier assignment
        Application security: WebAssembly information flow analysis, practice of backporting fixes in package dependency networks, technical lag and vulnerabilities in DockerHub images, security risks of compiling to WebAssembly
        My group has published over 100 peer-reviewed articles in the domain, and has been actively involved in collaborative research projects of a fundamental, strategic, or applied nature. Do reach out in case you are interested in a collaboration!

continuations, etc for wasm.

> The goal of my research is to enable the development of high-performance applications with robust correctness guarantees. To achieve this goal, I build practical programmable software systems that target realistic workloads in widely-used environments. I build my systems on solid foundations using formal specifications and techniques drawn from the programming languages, compilers, and formal methods literature.
