To compile FFmpeg with full support from source, you'll need to follow these steps:

First, clone the FFmpeg repository:

Copy
git clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git
cd ffmpeg
Install dependencies. On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can use:
q

Copy

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake build-essential cmake git-core libass-dev libfreetype6-dev libgnutls28-dev libmp3lame-dev libsdl2-dev libtool libva-dev libvdpau-dev libvorbis-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-shm0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev meson ninja-build pkg-config texinfo wget yasm zlib1g-dev nasm libx264-dev libx265-dev libnuma-dev libvpx-dev libfdk-aac-dev libopus-dev
```

Configure the build. For full support, you might use:
jboss-cli

Copy
```bash
./configure --prefix="/opt/ffmpeg" --enable-gpl --enable-nonfree --enable-libass --enable-libfdk-aac --enable-libfreetype --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libopus --enable-libvorbis --enable-libvpx --enable-libx264 --enable-libx265 --enable-sdl2
```
Compile FFmpeg:

Copy
make -j$(nproc)
Install FFmpeg:

Copy
sudo make install
Update the shared library cache:

Copy
sudo ldconfig
Please note that this compilation includes non-free components (--enable-nonfree) which might have license restrictions. Make sure you comply with all relevant licenses for your use case.

Also, the exact configuration options might vary depending on your specific needs and the libraries available on your system. The provided configuration enables many common features, but you may need to adjust it based on your requirements.

Remember that compiling from source requires significant system resources and can take a considerable amount of time, especially on less powerful systems.
