# compilers

Introduction

Changes in architecture changes in compilers

new features pose new problems

changing costs lead to different concerns

old solutions need re-engineering

Changes in compilers should prompt changes in architecture

New languages and features

Lexical analysis

LL parsing

LR parsing

JavaCC and JTB

Semantic analysis

Translation and simplification

Liveness analysis and register allocation

Activation Records

You have used several compilers
What qualities are important in a compiler?
1. Correct code
2. Output runs fast
3. Compiler runs fast
4. Compile time proportional to program size
5. Support for separate compilation
6. Good diagnostics for syntax errors
7. Works well with the debugger
8. Good diagnostics for flow anomalies
9. Cross language calls
10. Consistent, predictable optimization
