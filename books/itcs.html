        A technique used in many algorithms is to start at the beginning and
        take one step at a time towards the final destination.An algorithm that
        proceeds in this way is referred to as an iterative algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
        Though
        this sounds simple, designing, understanding, and describing such an
        algorithm can still be a daunting task. It becomes less daunting if we
        do not need to worry about the entire journey at once but can focus
        separately on one step at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
        The classic proverb advises us to
        focus first on the first step. This, however, is difficult to do before
        we know where we are going. Instead, I advise, first make a general
        statement about the types of places that the computation might be during
        its algorithmic journey. Then, given anyone such place, consider what
        single step the computation should take from there. This is the method
        of assertions and loop invariants.

          8.1 Assertions and Invariants as Boundaries between Parts
        </h2>
        <p>
          Whether you are designing an algorithm, coding an algorithm, trying to understand someone elseâ€™s
algorithm, describing an algorithm to someone else, or formally proving that an algorithm works,
you do not want to do it all at once. It is much easier to first break the algorithm into clear welldefined pieces and then to separately design, code, understand, describe, or prove correct each of
the pieces. Assertions provide clean boundaries between these parts. They state what the part can
expect to have already been accomplished when the part begins and what must be accomplished
when it completes. Invariants are the same, except they apply either to a loop that is executed
many times or to object oriented data structure that has an ongoing life.
        </p>
              <p>
          <b>
            Assertions as Boundaries around a Part:
        </b> An algorithm is broken into systems, subsystems,
routines, and subroutines. You must be very clear about the goals of the overall algorithm and
of each of these parts. Pre and postconditions are assertions that provide a clean boundary
around each of these.
