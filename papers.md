> The goal of my research is to enable the development of high-performance applications with robust correctness guarantees. To achieve this goal, I build practical programmable software systems that target realistic workloads in widely-used environments. I build my systems on solid foundations using formal specifications and techniques drawn from the programming languages, compilers, and formal methods literature.
